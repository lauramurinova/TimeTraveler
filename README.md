# XR Time Traveler

<div style="text-align: start; justify-content: center;">

**Summary:**  
XR Time Traveler takes the user through various timelines, from 400 million years ago through the Middle Ages to the current time. The project uses a mixture of MR and VR environments, allowing users to walk up close to a dinosaur or take a closer look into the virtual environment.

**Skills Utilized:**
- Unity
- Meta SDK (Anchors, Passthrough, Interaction, Locomotion)
- Customized models in Blender
- Maximo for animations

**Results:**
- I would love to upgrade the app once the understanding of surroundings in XR improves and it can customize the real space.
