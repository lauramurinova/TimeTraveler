<div style="text-align: start; justify-content: center;">

**Summary:**  
Realistic MR zombie defense game. Created its prototype within 7 days, worked with various animations, interpolated VR and MR world with wall destruction mechanism, and constructed the game logic and mechanics.

**Skills Utilized:**
- Unity
- Meta SDK (Anchors, Passthrough, Interaction)
- Maximo 3D Animations
- Unity Animations

**Results:**
- The app still needs a bit of work (polish more), but it presents an interesting and unique concept.

**Potential Improvements:**
- The app could be improved by introducing a health system to player and zombies, multiple weapons,
      extend it to different rooms and make the game logic more difficult, various levels.
